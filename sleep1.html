    <p><h4>sleeping is the most important and most beautyfull thing 
        but new gneration well known as {gen-Z} dont even know the 
        meaning of good sleep. sleeping is the only thing which 
        a gen-z can give
        to himself because there their full day is cluttered up with the technologies 
        .a average gen-z watches 4-5 hrs phone daily and extra time for 
        televison and latop
        and wasteing it on playing games and watching youtube . Gen-z is filed with the degradation of skills
        if we comparee to 90's knowladge reception it kids nowdays is much nowthen before generations, but the problem is they dont 
        knowhow to use it and for ?. and they get stuk into the loop of digital world which causes them 
        anxitey and depression and etc. which effects 
        so much on sleeping. the real beauty of sleeping is fantastic because
         your brain gets time for yourself and 
        thinks about self one . at the time of sleeping you can do any thing you want, but
         in your lovely dreams. 
        you can make your own world in your dreams where you can do anything you want to ,because you are the creator and god of that world
        it is the wonderfull place where is no tenson about studyes,watching phone,and other digital attractions.
        A PLACE where no work is needed ,just you and your thoughts which is cool right . so,how you can achieve it :- you can achieve this 
        wonderfull sleep by nutrilizeing each of your time on learning any skill or any meaningfull work which will give you the good 
        sleep for your hardwork as an gift . my example:- i like to spend my electric time on learning codeing or in studies for different
         competitive exams which makes me everytime buzy . or you can wear blue filtered glasses {When we’re exposed to blue light in the evening.
             the problem:- (for example, from screens), it stimulates specific cells in our 
        eyes that contain a photopigment called melanopsin
      These cells signal to our brain that it’s daytime, making it harder to fall asleep and potentially affecting sleep quality  } what blue light filtired 
      glasses works :-Blue light-filtering glasses work by blocking certain wavelengths of blue light from reaching our eyes,
         By doing so, they create a form of “physiologic darkness,” signaling to our brain that it’s nighttime.
          This can lead to improvements in both sleep quantity and quality.
