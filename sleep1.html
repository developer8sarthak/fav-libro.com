    <p><h4>sleeping is the most important and most beautyfull thing 
        but new gneration well known as {gen-Z} dont even know the 
        meaning of good sleep. sleeping is the only thing which a gen-z can give
        to himself because there their full day is cluttered up with the technologies 
        . a average gen-z watches 4-5 hrs phone daily and extra time for televison and latop
        and wasteing it on playing games and watching meaning-less videos
