    <p><h4>Sleeping is one of the most important and beautiful things, but the new generation, commonly known as Gen-Z, doesn’t fully understand the meaning 
        of good sleep. Sleep is something that Gen-Z can truly give to themselves, but their day is often cluttered with technology. On average, Gen-Z spends 4-5 hours daily on their phones, with additional time on television and laptops, often wasted on gaming or watching YouTube.

        Gen-Z is experiencing a decline in skill development compared to the knowledge 
        
        absorption of the 90s. While they have access to much more information, they often
         don’t know how to use it effectively, getting stuck in a loop of the digital world, which can lead to anxiety, 
         depression, and other issues that negatively impact sleep.
        
        The true beauty of sleep is fantastic because it gives your brain time to reflect and recharge.
         In dreams, you can create your own world and do anything you desire—you’re the creator and god of that space, free from 
         worries about studies, screens, and other digital distractions. It’s a place where no work is needed—just you and your thoughts. Cool, right?
        
        So, how can you achieve this wonderful sleep? You can attain it by investing your time in learning skills or engaging 
        in meaningful work, which will reward you with restful sleep as a gift for your hard work. For example, I like to
         spend my screen time learning to code or preparing for competitive exams, which keeps me productive.
        
        Another helpful approach is to wear blue-light-filtered glasses. When exposed to blue light in the evening—such as
         from screens—it stimulates cells in our eyes containing a pigment called melanopsin, signaling to our brain that it’s daytime. 
         This makes it harder to fall asleep and can affect sleep quality. 
         Blue-light-filtering glasses work by blocking specific wavelengths of blue light, creating a “physiologic darkness” that signals to our brain it’s nighttime,
          improving both the quantity and quality of sleep.
